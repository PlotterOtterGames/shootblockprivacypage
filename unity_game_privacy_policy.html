    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and shared when you use the Shoot Block mobile game ("the App").</p>

        <li>Improve advertising services</li>
        <li>Prevent fraud and abuse</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    
    <p>You can control personalized advertising by:</p>

    </ul>
    
    <p>You can also reset your advertising ID in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    
    <p>We do not share any personal information because we do not collect any. AdMob may share information with other Google services and third-party partners as outlined in Google's Privacy Policy.</p>
